# A/B Testing Framework for Vibrasonix

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the structured approach to experimentation for the Vibrasonix app, focusing on optimizing marketing effectiveness, user experience, and conversion rates. The framework provides guidelines for test design, implementation, analysis, and application of learnings to drive continuous improvement.

## Testing Objectives
- Optimize user acquisition cost and efficiency across channels
- Improve activation and onboarding completion rates
- Increase user retention and engagement metrics
- Enhance conversion rates from free to paid subscriptions
- Maximize the effectiveness of referral mechanisms

## Testing Principles
1. **Data-Driven Decisions**: All significant changes should be validated through testing
2. **One Variable at a Time**: Isolate variables to clearly attribute causality
3. **Statistical Significance**: Ensure sample sizes support confident conclusions
4. **User-Centric Focus**: Prioritize tests that enhance user experience
5. **Continuous Learning**: Document and share all test results, regardless of outcome

## Test Prioritization Framework
All potential tests will be evaluated using the PIE framework:
- **Potential**: Expected impact on key metrics (1-10)
- **Importance**: Strategic alignment with business goals (1-10)
- **Ease**: Resource requirements and implementation complexity (1-10)

## Testing Methodology

### Test Design Process
1. **Hypothesis Formation**
   - Clear statement of expected outcome
   - Based on user data, feedback, or industry insights
   - Linked to specific, measurable metrics

2. **Test Planning**
   - Define test variables and control elements
   - Determine sample size requirements
   - Set test duration based on traffic/user volumes
   - Establish success criteria and minimum detectable effect

3. **Implementation**
   - Technical setup and QA verification
   - Traffic allocation and segmentation
   - Monitoring for data collection issues

4. **Analysis**
   - Statistical significance evaluation
   - Segment-level impact assessment
   - Secondary and unintended effects analysis

5. **Implementation**
   - Winner determination and rollout plan
   - Documentation of learnings
   - Follow-up test ideation

### Sample Size and Duration Guidelines

| Expected Conversion Rate | Minimum Detectable Effect | Required Sample Size (per variation) | Estimated Duration (at 1,000 daily users) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1-3% | 20% | 25,000 | 50 days |
| 3-5% | 15% | 15,000 | 30 days |
| 5-10% | 10% | 8,000 | 16 days |
| 10-20% | 5% | 6,000 | 12 days |
| >20% | 5% | 3,000 | 6 days |

*Note: Sample size calculations based on 95% confidence level and 80% statistical power*
