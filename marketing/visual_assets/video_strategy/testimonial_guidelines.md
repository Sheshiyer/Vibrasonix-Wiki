## Production Approach

### Visual Style
- Natural, authentic setting relevant to the testimonial (home, office, meditation space)
- Soft, natural lighting that creates a calm atmosphere
- Shallow depth of field for professional, cinematic quality
- B-roll footage showing app usage and daily activities
- Subtle branded elements (color grading, lower thirds)

### Interview Setup
- Comfortable, conversational environment
- Subject positioned slightly off-center (rule of thirds)
- Eye-line slightly off-camera (interviewer positioned beside camera)
- Clean, uncluttered background that won't distract from subject
- Lapel microphone for clear audio capture

### Filming Guidelines
- Record in 4K for flexibility in editing and future-proofing
- Capture 3-5 minutes of raw interview footage for each 30-second final testimonial
- Film multiple takes of key statements for editing options
- Capture natural moments before and after "official" responses
- Include footage of actual app usage in context
- Film additional B-roll of subject's environment and daily activities

## Editing Guidelines

### Structure
- Begin with compelling problem statement or result
- Follow narrative arc: problem → discovery → usage → results
- End with clear, quotable statement about impact or recommendation
- Keep pace engaging but not rushed
- Include app interface footage where relevant

### Style
- Authentic, minimal editing that preserves natural speech patterns
- Subtle cuts that maintain conversational flow
- Light color grading consistent with brand aesthetic
- Gentle background music that doesn't compete with speech
- Clean, minimal lower-third graphics for name/information

### Technical Specifications
- Export in multiple formats for different platforms
- Include subtitles for accessibility and social media viewing
- 16:9 aspect ratio for primary version
- Create square and vertical crops for social media platforms
- Optimize audio levels for mobile viewing

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Required Documentation
