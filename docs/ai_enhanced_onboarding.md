# AI-Enhanced Onboarding & Personalized Journey

This document outlines how Vibrasonix can leverage OpenAI APIs and the extensive album library (100+ hours across planetary tones, organs, metals, chakras, sleep, meditation, noise, etc.) to create a more personalized and effective onboarding experience and user journey.

## 1. AI-Enhanced Onboarding Process

### Current Onboarding Limitations

The current onboarding process:
- Collects basic goal information through predefined selections
- Offers the same explanatory content to all users
- Doesn't adapt language or examples to user's knowledge level
- Provides limited personalization based on explicit selections only

### OpenAI API Integration Opportunities

#### 1.1 Natural Language Goal Assessment

**Implementation:**
- Replace or augment the structured goal selection with a conversational interface
- Use OpenAI's Chat Completion API to analyze user's natural language responses
- Extract implicit goals, concerns, and preferences from free-text input

**Example Flow:**
1. Ask open-ended question: "What brings you to Vibrasonix today? Tell us a bit about what you hope to achieve."
2. User responds: "I've been having trouble sleeping lately because my mind races at night. I'm also interested in deepening my meditation practice, which I've been doing for about 6 months."
3. OpenAI API analyzes response to identify:
   - Primary goal: Sleep improvement
   - Secondary goal: Meditation enhancement
   - Context: Mind racing (anxiety/overthinking)
   - Experience level: Intermediate meditation practitioner
   - Implicit need: Calming techniques

**API Implementation:**
```javascript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are analyzing user goals for a sound therapy app. Extract primary goals, secondary goals, context, experience level, and implicit needs."
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: userResponse
    }
  ],
  response_format: { type: "json_object" }
});
```

#### 1.2 Adaptive Explanation Depth

**Implementation:**
- Tailor the scientific explanations based on user's inferred knowledge level
- Adjust terminology, examples, and detail based on user sophistication
- Create dynamic onboarding content rather than fixed screens

**Example Adaptation:**
For a user who mentions "I know a bit about binaural beats but not much about PEMF":
- Provide basic refresher on binaural beats
- Offer more detailed explanation of PEMF technology
- Use analogies that connect the familiar (binaural beats) to the unfamiliar (PEMF)

**API Implementation:**
```javascript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "Generate an explanation of PEMF technology for a user who understands binaural beats but is unfamiliar with PEMF. Keep it under 100 words."
    }
  ]
});
```

#### 1.3 Personalized Content Recommendations

**Implementation:**
- Use OpenAI's API to match user's stated goals and context with specific content
- Generate personalized "starter pack" of recommended content
- Create custom session sequences based on user's specific situation

**Example Scenario:**
For a user who mentions trouble sleeping due to racing thoughts:
1. API analyzes this specific sleep issue
2. Recommends a progressive sequence:
   - Evening: "Mental Unwinding" (Alpha to Theta transition)
   - Bedtime: "Thought Quieting" (Theta dominant)
   - Sleep: "Deep Delta Immersion" (Delta dominant)

**API Implementation:**
```javascript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "Create a 3-session sequence for a user with racing thoughts affecting sleep. Select from our content library categories: [planetary tones, organs, metals, chakras, sleep, meditation, noise]. Include frequency recommendations."
    }
  ],
  response_format: { type: "json_object" }
});
```

## 2. Leveraging the Extensive Album Library

### 2.1 Content Tagging & Classification

**Implementation:**
- Use OpenAI's API to generate comprehensive metadata for all content
- Create multi-dimensional classification beyond basic categories
- Develop a rich tagging system that captures subtle content characteristics

**Metadata Dimensions:**
- Primary frequency range (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
- Emotional tone (Calming, Energizing, Focusing, Balancing, etc.)
- Intensity curve (Steady, Progressive, Oscillating, etc.)
- Recommended time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
- Complementary activities (Meditation, Sleep, Work, Exercise, etc.)
- Cultural influence (Western, Eastern, Indigenous, etc.)
- Instrument/sound type (Natural, Synthesized, Vocal, etc.)

**API Implementation:**
```javascript
// For each album/track in the library
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "Analyze this sound therapy track and generate metadata tags across these dimensions: [frequency range, emotional tone, intensity curve, time of day, complementary activities, cultural influence, sound type]"
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `Track title: ${track.title}\nDescription: ${track.description}\nCategory: ${track.category}\nDuration: ${track.duration}`
    }
  ],
  response_format: { type: "json_object" }
});
```

### 2.2 Dynamic Content Relationships

**Implementation:**
- Use OpenAI's API to identify relationships between content pieces
- Create a "content graph" that maps complementary and progressive relationships
- Enable intelligent sequencing of content based on user journey

**Relationship Types:**
- Sequential (Track A naturally leads to Track B)
- Complementary (Track A and B work well together)
- Contrasting (Track A and B provide beneficial contrast)
- Progressive (Tracks A→B→C form an effective intensity progression)
- Thematic (Tracks share conceptual themes but different approaches)

**API Implementation:**
```javascript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "Analyze these two sound therapy tracks and identify their relationship type (sequential, complementary, contrasting, progressive, thematic) and explain why."
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `Track 1: ${track1.metadata}\nTrack 2: ${track2.metadata}`
    }
  ],
  response_format: { type: "json_object" }
});
```

### 2.3 Content Effectiveness Prediction

**Implementation:**
- Use OpenAI's API to predict content effectiveness for specific user goals
- Create a personalized ranking system based on user profile

3. Generate effectiveness prediction scores
4. Rank content based on predicted relevance
5. Update predictions based on user feedback

**API Implementation:**
```javascript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "Predict the effectiveness (0-100) of these tracks for this user's goals and explain why."
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `User profile: ${userProfile}\nTracks: ${tracksMetadata}`
    }
