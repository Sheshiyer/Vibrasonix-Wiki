## Asset Creation Process

### Photo Selection & Editing

1. **Starting Point:** Select high-quality stock photos featuring:
   - People wearing headphones
   - People using the Vibrasonix-Cube device on beds
   - Diverse representation (age, ethnicity, gender)
   - Calm, focused, or meditative expressions
   - Good lighting with room for effects

2. **Color Grading Process:**
   - Decrease saturation by 20-30%
   - Shift color balance toward blue tones
   - Increase shadows slightly (+10-15%)
   - Reduce highlights slightly (-10%)
   - Apply subtle vignette effect

3. **Effect Application:**
   - Add subtle rim lighting around subject
   - Apply very gentle gaussian blur to edges (2-3px)
   - Create mask for adding sound wave overlay effects
   - Ensure transparent background for app integration

4. **Final Format:**
   - Save as PNG with transparency
   - Create @1x, @2x, and @3x versions
   - Optimize file size while maintaining quality

### Animation Creation

1. **Sound Wave Animations:**
   - Begin with basic sine wave form
   - Add variations in amplitude and frequency
   - Apply smooth easing functions
   - Ensure 60fps for smoothest effect
   - Test on device to verify performance

2. **Transition Animations:**
   - Use consistent timing (300-400ms duration)
   - Apply easy-in, easy-out easing
   - For screen transitions, use subtle slide and fade
   - Maintain consistent direction (e.g., forward = slide left)

3. **Interactive Animations:**
   - Button press effects: Subtle scale (95-100%)
   - Selection states: Gentle glow effect
   - Loading indicators: Circular progress with brand colors

4. **Optimization:**
   - Keep Lottie animations under 150kb
   - Test on older devices to ensure performance
   - Provide fallback static images

## Implementation Notes

### Asset Organization

Organize assets in the following structure:
```
/assets
  /backgrounds
    - cosmic_bg_01.png
    - cosmic_bg_02.png
    - ...
  /icons
    /nav
      - home.svg
      - library.svg
      - ...
    /goals
      - sleep.svg
      - focus.svg
      - ...
  /images
    - headphones_01.png
    - headphones_02.png
    - ...
  /animations
    - logo_anim.json
    - wave_visualization.json
    - ...
  /buttons
    - primary_button.png
    - secondary_button.png
    - ...
```

### Image Optimization

- PNG files should be compressed using TinyPNG or similar
- SVG files should be optimized with SVGO
- Lottie animations should be optimized for mobile
- Consider implementing a lazy loading strategy for larger images

### Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure sufficient contrast for text (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Provide text alternatives for images
- Support system text size adjustments
- Test with screen readers for important elements
