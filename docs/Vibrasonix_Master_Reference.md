## Core App Concept

Vibrasonix is a sound therapy application that combines binaural beats, PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) technology, and vibroacoustic therapy through science-backed soundscapes to help users improve various aspects of their mental wellbeing:

- **Sleep enhancement** - Delta wave entrainment (0.5-4 Hz) for deep restorative sleep
- **Focus improvement** - Alpha and Gamma frequencies (8-12 Hz, 30-50 Hz) for enhanced cognition
- **Stress & anxiety reduction** - Reduce cortisol levels and increase endorphins
- **Meditation enhancement** - Theta frequencies (4-7 Hz) for hypnagogic states
- **Sound healing** - Vibroacoustic therapy across the 30-120 Hz therapeutic range
- **Spiritual exploration** - Access expanded states of consciousness

The app positions sound and electromagnetic pulses as powerful tools for mental and physical state transformation, using the metaphor of a "drug without side effects" to create a compelling value proposition. The Vibrasonix-Cube device delivers therapeutic vibrations directly to the user's body through their bed.

## App Personality

**Scientific yet accessible, technology-driven but approachable, empowering not patronizing.**

The app balances scientific credibility with cutting-edge technology, using direct, personal language that guides without condescension. Every visual and textual element should reinforce this personality.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Science-Backed Approach**: All sound experiences and PEMF patterns are grounded in research about frequency effects on brainwaves and body
2. **Integrated Hardware-Software Solution**: The Vibrasonix-Cube device works with the app to deliver a complete therapeutic experience
3. **Personalized Journey**: User goals and preferences drive content recommendations
4. **Visual-Sonic Harmony**: Visual design elements reinforce and enhance the sonic experience
5. **Cosmic-Neural Aesthetic**: Unique visual identity merging cosmic elements with neural patterns

## Color System

- **Primary: Deep Blue (#1A1A2E)** - Base of UI, represents depth and possibility
- **Secondary: Teal Blue (#48AAAD)** - Interactive elements, highlighted text
- **Accent: Gold (#FFBD00)** - Logo, important accents, premium features
- **Text: White (#FFFFFF) and Light Gray (#E0E0E0)** - For optimal readability
- **Highlight: Teal Blue (#48AAAD)** - For important keywords in copy

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Onboarding Flow** (Screens 1-9)
   - Critical for user understanding and buy-in
   - Focus on smooth transitions and compelling visuals
   - Ensure copy clearly communicates value proposition

2. **Personalization** (Screens 8-12)
   - Goal selection and preference gathering
   - Dynamic content based on selections
   - Clear feedback on how selections impact experience

3. **Conversion Points** (Screens 13-14)
   - Account creation with minimal friction
   - Compelling subscription presentation
   - Clear free vs. premium value proposition

4. **Core Experience** (Screen 15)
   - Personalized content display
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Seamless playback experience

## Key Screens & Elements

## Development Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize animations for 60fps on most devices
   - Consider memory usage for animation caching
   - Implement progressive asset loading

2. **Accessibility Requirements**
   - Ensure all elements are screen reader compatible
   - Support dynamic text sizing
   - Provide reduced motion alternatives
   - Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

3. **Error Handling**

   - Clear error messages for user inputs
   - Fallback states for missing content

## Testing Strategy

1. **Usability Testing**
   - Test goal selection and personalization flow
   - Measure time to complete onboarding
   - Identify any points of confusion or dropout

2. **A/B Testing Opportunities**
   - Test different versions of drug metaphor screen
   - Compare conversion rates with different subscription presentations
   - Test ordering of goal selection options

3. **Technical Testing**
   - Performance testing on various devices
