# Project Scope

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a mobile application, "Vibrasonix," that delivers personalized and effective sound therapy experiences. This application aims to leverage binaural beats, PEMF frequencies, and vibroacoustic therapy principles to enhance user wellbeing across various domains, including sleep, focus, stress reduction, and meditation. The app will be designed to seamlessly integrate with the Vibrasonix-Cube hardware device to offer an enhanced vibroacoustic therapy experience.

## Key Features

- **Crystal Flow UI:** Develop a visually engaging and intuitive user interface, as detailed in `V1/UI-overview.md` and `V1/components.md`, centered around the "Crystal" metaphor. This includes core components like `CrystalContainer`, `CrystalWaveform`, and `CrystalControls`, and reusable widgets like `Buttons`, `Sliders`, and `Cards`.
- **Sound Therapy Modes:** Implement various sound therapy modes, including:
    - **Personalized Soundscapes:** AI-driven playlist generation based on user goals and preferences.
    - **Curated Content Library:** A rich library of soundscapes categorized for different needs (sleep, focus, meditation, stress relief).
    - **Vibracoustic Therapy Integration:**  Synchronization with Vibrasonix-Cube for enhanced therapy sessions.
- **Cymatics Visualization:** Implement dynamic cymatics patterns that respond in real-time to the audio being played, providing a visual representation of sound vibrations.
- **Haptic Feedback:** Develop a sophisticated haptic feedback system that translates sound frequencies into precise vibration patterns delivered through the phone's haptic engine.
- **Interactive Controls:** Provide user-friendly and interactive controls for soundscape sessions:
    - Playback controls (play/pause, skip, volume, timer).
    - Intensity and duration adjustments.
    - Potential integration with Vibrasonix-Cube controls.
- **Session Tracking and Analytics:** Implement user session tracking and analytics to:
    - Monitor usage patterns and progress towards goals.
    - Provide personalized insights and feedback to users.
    - Collect anonymized data for app improvement and content optimization.
- **User Authentication and Personalization:**
    - Secure user account creation and login.
    - Profile management and preference settings.
    - Goal selection and personalized content recommendations.
- **Accessibility Features:** Incorporate comprehensive accessibility options as outlined in `V1/PRS.md` to cater to users with diverse needs.

## Constraints

- **Performance Optimization:** The app must be optimized for performance to ensure smooth soundscape playback, responsive UI, and efficient battery usage on mobile devices.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:**  Design and develop the app to ensure a consistent user experience across both iOS and Android platforms, adhering to platform-specific UI guidelines where appropriate while maintaining a unified brand aesthetic.
- **Vibrasonix-Cube Integration:**  Seamless and reliable integration with the Vibrasonix-Cube hardware is critical. This includes robust Bluetooth connectivity and synchronized control of sound and vibration.
- **Content Library Development:**  Curating and developing a high-quality and diverse library of soundscapes is essential for user engagement and satisfaction.
- **AI-Personalization Engine:**  Developing an effective AI-driven personalization engine that accurately recommends soundscapes based on user goals and preferences is a key technical challenge.
- **Timeline:** Project completion within the estimated timeline, requiring efficient resource allocation and focused development efforts.
